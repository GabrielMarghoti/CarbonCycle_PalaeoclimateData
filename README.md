Research Question

Climate is strongly coupled to the carbon cycle. Can we identify typical pattern of this coupling in palaeoclimate data?

Hints

- For comparing palaeoclimate and carbon cycle variations, δ18O and δ13C proxy records can be used. Consider two different time scales: (1) thousands of years and (2) millions of years. For the short time scale, you can use speleothem based proxies, e.g., the YOK-I record from Yok Balum Cave in Belize (DOI:10.5880/pik.2017.004). For the long time scale, you can use the CENOGRID proxy record (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14199322). However, you are free to select other proxy time series if they are suitable to answer the research question.

- Develop a framework to compare the relationship between δ18O and δ13C values temporaly. Allow for slight varying delays between them. Age uncertainties do not need to be considered.

- Compare using linear and nonlinear methods (e.g., Pearson/ Spearman correlation, mutual information, τ-recurrence rate based synchronisation).

- Test for different band-pass filtered versions of the data. Discuss the best choice.

- Interpret the temporal variation of the coupling between δ18O and δ13C and discuss the potentials and pitfalls of this comparison.
